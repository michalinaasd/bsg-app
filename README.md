## Reflection

This project was done as a recruitment assigment.  The main goal was to create a web application for watching video content. 

For the login form validation, I decided to use React Hook Form and Yup. React Hook From solution brings very clean and simple code with local validation (but it also allows using a validation schema). 

I used ChakraUI for styling because it is easily configurable and has support for dark mode.
